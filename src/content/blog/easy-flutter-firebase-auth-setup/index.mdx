Managing user authentication in your app can be a pain. Firebase Auth provides
an easy solution for this without needing a server of your own. Unless you were
living under a rock for the past few years, you've probably already heard about
Firebase. If not, I suggest you check out the
[Firebase Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs)

In this article, I will be showing you how to set up a simple authentication
system using Firebase in your Flutter app. I won't be implementing proper folder
structure or error handling today.

The focus of this tutorial is to get you up and running as quickly as possible
with a functional authentication system. With the knowledge you gain here, you
can always add more functionalities to your app.

I assume you already

- know how to create a flutter app
- know a little something about Firebase Auth
- know how to create a Firebase project and connect to your Flutter app

If you want to learn how to install flutter and setup a simple Flutter app,
check out the [Flutter docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

Refer to this
[guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=android) if you
don't know how to connect your Flutter app to Firebase.

With that out of the way, let's get started!

Here is what we will build:

{/* <BlogImage alt="demo" src="https://i.imgur.com/TapmrG6.gif" /> */}

For the sake of simplicity, I will be using the `signInAnnonymously` method to
create a user account. You can always switch it for any other sign in method and
it should work.

### Project cleanup

A fresh Flutter project usually comes with a default counter app. First, we will
do some cleanup to get rid of the default app and start freshly.

Delete everything inside the `lib/main.dart` file and replace it with the
following.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main()  {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Firebase Auth',
      home: const Scaffold(),
    ),
  }
}
```

Here, We have stripped out the default app and replaced it with an empty
`Scaffold`. It won't display anything interesting now but we will come back to
this later.

### Installing the dependencies

Let's first install all the dependencies we will be needing. Add the following
dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file and run `flutter pub get` on your
terminal to install them (if it doesn't start installing automatically).

```yaml
firebase_auth: ^3.3.5
firebase_core: ^1.11.0
provider: ^6.0.2
```

`firebase_core` package is what other firebase packages depend on. We must add
this package if we are using any other firebase packages. `firebase_auth` is the
package that enables us to use the Firebase authentication API. We will use the
`provider` package to easily pass our Authentication Service class down the
widget tree.

> I suggest you add the same versions of dependencies as mine to follow along.
> Depending on when you are reading this, later update to the latest versions if
> you need to.

### Initilaize Firebase

In order to start using Firebase services, we need to initialize it first. This
is where the `firebase_core` package we installed comes into play. Update the
`main` function as follows.

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

In line 2, we to have added `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();` to make
sure that the native codes required to initialize Firebase are loaded before
running the app.

In line 3, we are initializing Firebase using `Firebase.initializeApp()`. This
however is an asynchronous call, thus we have to `await` it and add `async` to
the main function in order to be able to use the `await` keyword.

> Make sure to import `package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart` on top of the
> file.

### Creating the Authentication Service

Next, we will create our Authentication service where we will define the
authentication logics to handle user sign in and sign out.

```dart
class AuthService {
  final FirebaseAuth _firebaseAuth;

  AuthService(this._firebaseAuth);

  Stream<User?> get authStateChanges => _firebaseAuth.idTokenChanges();

  void signOut() async {
    await _firebaseAuth.signOut();
  }

  void signIn() async {
    await _firebaseAuth.signInAnonymously();
  }
}
```

In line 2, we have created a private member variable called `_firebaseAuth`
which is of type `FirebaseAuth`. This is the object that we will use to interact
with the Firebase Authentication API.

Then in the constructor function, we are expecting to get an instance of
`FirebaseAuth` which we will assign to the `_firebaseAuth` variable.

In line 6, we have defined a getter that returns a `Stream` of type `User`. This
is the most important piece of the puzzle. We will make use of this getter to
conditionally display the Home page or the Login page. This `User` type is
coming from the `firebase_auth` package. If we don't have a `User` it will
return null, therefore we will use the `?` operator after `User` to tell the
compiler that we might expect a `null` value at some point.

This `Stream` of `User` is coming from the `idTokenChanges` method of our
`FirebaseAuth` instance. According to the docs, this function notifies about
changes to the user's sign-in state (such as sign-in or sign-out) and also token
refresh events.

Finally, we have two simple functions to sign out and sign in the user that
reaches out to Firebase's API, and calls the `signOut` and `signInAnonymously`
methods respectively.

> Make sure to import `package:firebase_auth/firebase_auth.dart`.

### Creating the Home Page and Sign In Page

Next, we will create a simple home page and a sign in page.

```dart
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomePage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Home'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {},
              child: const Text("Sign out"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SignInPage extends StatelessWidget {
  const SignInPage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Sign In'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {},
              child: const Text("Sign in"),
            )
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Nothing fancy here. We have created two stateless widgets one for each page. In
both pages, we are displaying an `ElevatedButton` with a `Text` widget in the
center of the screen. The `onPressed` callback functions of the buttons don't do
anything for now.

### Creating the Authentication Wrapper

Finally, we will create a wrapper widget that we will call `AuthWrapper`. It
will be responsible for displaying the home page or the sign in page depending
on the user's sign in state. We will simply return a `StreamBuilder` widget that
will listen to the `authStateChanges` stream from our `AuthService` class.

```dart
class AuthWrapper extends StatelessWidget {
  const AuthWrapper({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StreamBuilder(
      stream: context.read<AuthService>().authStateChanges,
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.hasData) {
          return const HomePage();
        }
        return const SignInPage();
      },
    );
  }
}
```

We can use the `context.read` method of the `provider` package to access the
`AuthService` instance (which we will provide down the widget tree in the next
step).

> Make sure to import `package:provider/provider.dart`

Then in the builder function, we are using the `snapshot` parameter to check if
we have a `User`. If we do, we will return the `HomePage`. If we don't, we will
return the `SignInPage`. Simple enough.

### Putting everything together

Now that we have the basics in place, let's put everything together.

First, we will make some changes to the `MyApp` widget.

```dart {6,7,10}
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Provider<AuthService>(
      create: (_) => AuthService(FirebaseAuth.instance),
      child: const MaterialApp(
        title: 'Flutter Firebase Auth',
        home: AuthWrapper(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In line 6, instead of returning the `MaterialApp` widget, we will return a
`Provider` of type `AuthService`. Provider widget is coming from the Provider
package we installed. We will return an instance of the `AuthService` class in
the `create` function by passing in the `FirebaseAuth.instance` as an argument.
Then we will return the `MaterialApp` widget as the child of the `Provider`
widget. This will allow us to access the `AuthService` instance from anywhere in
the app.

In line 10, we will remove the `Scaffold` and return the `AuthWrapper` widget
from the `MaterialApp`.

With that change, we are almost done except we need to add the functionality to
sign in and sign out the user.

For this, we will revisit the `SignInPage` and `HomePage` widgets.

In the `SignInPage` widget, we will add the method to sign in a user within the
`onPressed` callback of the `ElevatedButton` like so.

Once again, we will use the `context.read` method to access the `AuthService`

```dart {5}
class SignInPage extends StatelessWidget {
  ...
    ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () {
        context.read<AuthService>().signIn();
      },
      child: const Text("Sign out"),
    ),
  ...
}
```

Also, in the `HomePage` widget, we will add the method to sign out a user.

```dart {5}
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  ...
    ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () {
        context.read<AuthService>().signOut();
      },
      child: const Text("Sign out"),
    ),
  ...
}
```

That's it. We have now implemented a simple yet powerful authentication system
within our Flutter app using Firebase.
