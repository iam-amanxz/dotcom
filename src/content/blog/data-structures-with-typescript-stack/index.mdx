This is the first of a multi-part series where we will be implementing some
popular data structures using TypeScript. This week's focus is Stack data
structure.

<br />
## What is a Stack?

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the order of **Last In First
Out(LIFO).** This means the first inserted element will be removed last. You can
think of the stack as a pile of books that are placed on top of one another.

<br />
## Use cases of Stack data structure.

The stack can be useful in a situation where the order of the data inserted is
important. Following are some common scenarios where stack can be useful.

- **Javascript call stack** - Keep track of function calls
- **Undo/Redo** - Undo by removing the last element in the stack, and redo by
  inserting the last removed item from the stack
- **Reversing** - Reverse a string

<br />
## Basic operations of a Stack

A stack should be able to perform the following basic operations.

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of a stack
- **Pop**: Remove an element from the top of a stack
- **IsEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty
- **IsFull**: Check if the stack is full
- **Peek**: Get the value of the top element without removing it

## Implementation

In order to implement the Stack data structure, we can follow the following
steps.

- Define a variable called `TOP` to keep track of the first element in the stack
- When initialized, set the value of `TOP` to `-1`. Later we can use this to
  check if the stack is empty or not.
- Whenever an item is pushed, increase the value of `**TOP**` by 1 and place the
  new element at the position pointed by `TOP`. Also, check if the stack is full
  before pushing a new element.
- Whenever an item is popped, decrease the value of `TOP` by 1. Also, check if
  the stack is empty before popping an element.

Following is the TyepeScript implementation of the Stack data structure

<aside>
  💡 Since we are using **`Array`** data structure to implement the stack, we
  can get away with not using the **`TOP`** variable at all. We already have the
  required index information built into JavaScript arrays.

```ts
class Stack<T> {
  private _top: number
  private _capacity: number
  private _stack: T[]

  constructor(capacity: number) {
    this._top = -1
    this._capacity = capacity
    this._stack = [] as T[]
  }

  get stack() {
    return this._stack
  }

  isEmpty(): boolean {
    return this._top === -1
  }

  isFull(): boolean {
    return this._top === this._capacity - 1
  }

  peek(): T {
    return this._stack[0]
  }

  push(item: T) {
    if (this.isFull()) {
      console.log('Failed: Maximum capacity reached')
      return false
    }

    this._stack.push(item)
    this._top++
  }

  pop() {
    if (this.isEmpty()) {
      console.log('Failed: Stack is already empty')
      return false
    }

    this._stack.pop()
    this._top--
  }

  printStack() {
    this._stack.forEach((item, index) => {
      console.log(`Item at index ${index} => ${item}`)
    })
  }
}
```

## Testing

Now that we have implemented the Stack data structure using TypeScript, it is
time to test the functionalities of our Stack. We will be using Jest to write
some important test cases.

```ts
describe('test stack functionality', () => {
  it('should be empty when initialized', () => {
    const stack = new Stack(10)
    const isEmpty = stack.isEmpty()

    expect(isEmpty).toBe(true)
  })

  it('should be full when max capacity is reached', () => {
    const stack = new Stack<string>(2)
    stack.push('🐅')
    stack.push('🐐')
    const isFull = stack.isFull()

    expect(isFull).toBe(true)
  })

  it('should add items to the stack', () => {
    const stack = new Stack<number>(3)
    stack.push(2)
    stack.push(3)

    expect(stack.stack).toStrictEqual([2, 3])
  })

  it('should remove items from the stack', () => {
    const stack = new Stack<string>(5)
    stack.push('a')
    stack.push('b')
    stack.push('c')
    stack.push('d')
    stack.push('e')
    stack.pop()
    stack.pop()

    expect(stack.stack).toStrictEqual(['a', 'b', 'c'])
  })

  it('should not allow adding more item than the capacity', () => {
    const stack = new Stack<number>(1)
    stack.push(2)
    const status = stack.push(3)

    expect(status).toBe(false)
  })

  it('should not allow removing item when the stack is empty', () => {
    const stack = new Stack<number>(1)
    const status = stack.pop()

    expect(status).toBe(false)
  })

  it('should return the first element', () => {
    const stack = new Stack<string>(3)
    stack.push('hello')
    stack.push('world')
    stack.push('people')
    const firstElement = stack.peek()

    expect(firstElement).toBe('hello')
  })
})
```
