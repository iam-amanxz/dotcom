'Render Props' is one of many ways to share common functionality between
components in React. Render props achieves this by taking a function as a prop.
This function exposes the data via its argument to the React component that is
returned. This prop is usually called `render`. Hence the name 'Render Props'.

The usage of Render Props would look like this:

```javascript {showline}
<DataProvider
  render={(data) => {
    return <span>{data.title}</span>
  }}
/>
```

In this example, `DataProvider` is a component that holds some kind of data or
common functionality. It exposes this data to the `span` element via its
`render` prop.

Here, the `Data Provider` component doesn't care about the component that is
returned from the function. Its whole purpose is to expose some data to whatever
component that is being returned.

You might have heard of a similar pattern called Higher Order Components (HOC)
before. Both of these patterns ultimately solve the same problem in a different
fashion. But let's keep the HOC for a different day. If you are wondering when
to choose one over the other, it's totally up to you.

## Defining the use case for Render Props

Before diving into the implementation details, let's come up with a scenario
when we might wanna make use of Render Props. Assume you have a `Layout`
component that renders a sidebar. You want the sidebar to be hidden when the
screen size is less than 768px. And you have a `DeviceSummary` component that
simply displays the device information such as screen height and width to the
user.

Both of these components are not related to each other in any way. However, they
still need to know about the device screen size information. This is when we
need to think about providing the screen size information from a central place.
This way, later down the road if we need this information in some other
component, we don't have to implement the logic again. This is where render
props come in.

To achieve this, we will create a `ScreenSizeProvider` component that will hold
the functionality to calculate the device screen width and height. We will
expose this information via Render Props to our `Layout` component and
`DeviceSummary` component.

## Implementing Render Props with class based components

Now that the scope is clear, let's see how we can achieve this with a class
based component.

#### Let's define some milestones:

1. Create a `ScreenSizeProvider` component and implement the logic to calculate
   and expose device screen size information
2. Get the current screen width from the `ScreenSizeProvider` and conditionally
   render the `Sidebar` component inside the layout component.
3. Get the current screen width and height from the `ScreenSizeProvider` and
   display that inside the `DeviceSummary` component.

We will create the `ScreenSizeProvider` component like follows:

```javascript
import React from 'react'

class ScreenSizeProvider extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      screenWidth: 0,
      screenHeight: 0,
    }
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.updateWindowDimensions()
    window.addEventListener('resize', this.updateWindowDimensions)
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    window.removeEventListener('resize', this.updateWindowDimensions)
  }

  updateWindowDimensions = () => {
    this.setState({
      screenWidth: window.innerWidth,
      screenHeight: window.innerHeight,
    })
  }

  render() {
    return this.props.render(this.state)
  }
}
```

#### Let's break down what we did above:

First We created a class based component called `ScreenSizeProvider` that
extends `React.Component`.

Then we added a piece of state to the component with initial `screenWidth`, and
`screenHeight` is set to 0. We will use this state to keep track of the screen
width and height.

```javascript
class ScreenSizeProvider extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      screenWidth: 0,
      screenHeight: 0,
    }
  }
}
```

Then we added a `componentDidMount` lifecycle method to the component. Here,
`updateWindowDimensions` functions is called as soon as the component is mounted
to the DOM. We will define this function in the next steps. This will be the
function that is responsible for getting the screen width and height, and
updating the state respectively.

Next we added a `resize` event listener to the `window` object. This event
listener takes our `updateWindowDimensions` function as a callback. This means,
whenever the window is resized, the `updateWindowDimensions` function will be
called. This will allow us to get the latest screen width and height every time
the screen is resized.

```javascript
componentDidMount() {
  this.updateWindowDimensions();
  window.addEventListener('resize', this.updateWindowDimensions);
}
```

Then we removed the event listener using the `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle
method. This will happen before the component is removed from the DOM. This is a
good place to remove any event listeners that we no longer need. This is nothing
but a performance optimization to avoid memory leaks in our application.

```javascript
componentWillUnmount() {
  window.removeEventListener('resize', this.updateWindowDimensions);
}
```

Next we defined the `updateWindowDimensions` function. This function will get
the current screen width using `window.innerWidth`, and current screen height
using `window.innerHeight`, and update the `screenWidth` and `screenHeight`
states respectively.

```javascript
updateWindowDimensions = () => {
  this.setState({
    screenWidth: window.innerWidth,
    screenHeight: window.innerHeight,
  })
}
```

Finally, the important piece to the puzzle. We defined the `render` method and
returned the `render` function passed via props along with the state. I know it
sounds a little confusing.

Here, `render` is a method that belongs to the `React.Component` class. This
method is required to return something from the component. `props.render` is
what we are returning from this component.

```javascript
render() {
  return this.props.render(this.state);
}
```

If it's still confusing, assume the prop name that we will give to the
`ScreenSizeProvider` is going to be called `build`. In that case, the render
method will look like this:

```javascript
render() {
  return this.props.build(this.state);
}
```

I hope this is clear now.

Now that we have defined the `ScreenSizeProvider` component, we can make use of
it to get the information we need and conditionally render the `Sidebar`
component inside the `Layout` component:

```javascript
import React from 'react'

class Layout extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ScreenSizeProvider
        render={(screenSize) => {
          return screenSize.screenWidth > 768 && <Sidebar />
        }}
      />
    )
  }
}
```

As you can see, we are using the `ScreenSizeProvider` component inside the
`Layout` component to get the screen size information via its render prop. Then
we are returning the `Sidebar` component only if the screen width is greater
than 768px.

Now, let's see how we can utilize the same technique inside the `DeviceSummary`
component as well. This should be simple enough.

```javascript
import React from 'react'

class DeviceSummary extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ScreenSizeProvider
        render={(screenSize) => (
          <div>
            <h1>Your Device Summary</h1>
            <p>Screen Width: {screenSize.screenWidth}px</p>
            <p>Screen Height: {screenSize.screenHeight}px</p>
          </div>
        )}
      />
    )
  }
}
```

Congratulations! Just like that, we have reused the functionality to calculate
the screen size information inside both `Layout` and `DeviceSummary` components
by extracting it away to a central place.

Now you may have an idea about the other scenarios where you might need to
consider using the Render Props pattern.

## Putting it together with a functional component.

Class based components are soft deprecated and might be removed in the future
versions of React. In the modern React world, we use functional components
instead. Therefore, it is a must to understand how we can implement the render
props pattern with functional components. Nonetheless, It doesn't hurt to learn
how class based components work.

Let's take everything we have learned so far and put it together with a
functional component. I will take the same use case from above in order to keep
this simple and relevant.

We will create our `ScreenSizeProvider` component first.

```javascript
import React from 'react'

const ScreenSizeProvider = (props) => {
  const [screenWidth, setScreenWidth] = React.useState(0)
  const [screenHeight, setScreenHeight] = React.useState(0)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    updateWindowDimensions()
    window.addEventListener('resize', updateWindowDimensions)
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('resize', updateWindowDimensions)
    }
  }, [])

  const updateWindowDimensions = () => {
    setScreenWidth(window.innerWidth)
    setScreenHeight(window.innerHeight)
  }

  return props.render({ screenWidth, screenHeight })
}
```

#### Let's break down:

First, we created the `ScreenSizeProvider` component with ES6 arrow function
syntax. This component will take the `props` as an argument.

```javascript
const ScreenSizeProvider = (props) => {
  ...
};
```

Then we added 2 pieces of state to the component using the `useState` hook from
React. `useState` hook returns an array with the current state value and a
function to update that state. it takes an initial value as an argument.

We will use it to define `screenWidth` and `screenHeight` states and set their
initial value to 0 as before.

```javascript
const [screenWidth, setScreenWidth] = React.useState(0)
const [screenHeight, setScreenHeight] = React.useState(0)
```

Next, we used the `useEffect` hook from React to call our
`updateWindowDimensions` function when the component is mounted. And we set the
`resize` event listener to the window object by passing `updateWindowDimensions`
as a callback in order to update the screen size information when the screen is
resized.

You can think of the `useEffect` hook as an all-in-one component lifecycle
method. You can read more about it
[here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect).

The return function inside the `useEffect` hook will be called before the
component is removed from the UI. We can use this to remove the event listener
when the component is unmounted to avoid memory leaks as before.

The empty array as the second argument to the `useEffect` hook is the dependency
array. Empty array means that the `useEffect` will only run once when the
component is mounted.

```javascript
React.useEffect(() => {
  updateWindowDimensions()
  window.addEventListener('resize', updateWindowDimensions)
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('resize', updateWindowDimensions)
  }
}, [])
```

Next we defined the `updateWindowDimensions` function. This function will use
the `setScreenWidth` and `setScreenHeight` functions to update the `screenWidth`
and `screenHeight` state respectively.

```javascript
const updateWindowDimensions = () => {
  setScreenWidth(window.innerWidth)
  setScreenHeight(window.innerHeight)
}
```

Finally, we returned the `props.render` function with the screen size
information by passing `screenWidth` and `screenHeight` to it.

```javascript
return props.render({ screenWidth, screenHeight })
```

That's it! We have now implemented render prop using a functional component. Now
we can use it the same way as before to conditionally render the `Sidebar`
component and display the device summary information as follows:

```javascript
const Layout = () => (
  <ScreenSizeProvider
    render={(screenSize) => {
      return screenSize.screenWidth > 768 && <Sidebar />
    }}
  />
)

const DeviceSummary = () => (
  <ScreenSizeProvider
    render={(screenSize) => (
      <div>
        <h1>Your Device Summary</h1>
        <p>Screen Width: {screenSize.screenWidth}px</p>
        <p>Screen Height: {screenSize.screenHeight}px</p>
      </div>
    )}
  />
)
```
