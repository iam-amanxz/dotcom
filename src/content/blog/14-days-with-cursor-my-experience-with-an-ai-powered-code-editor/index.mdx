Recently, I had the opportunity to try out [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), an AI-powered code editor, during its 14-day free trial period. As someone who loves exploring new tools that enhance productivity and streamline workflows, I was excited to dive in and see what Cursor had to offer. Here’s a breakdown of my thoughts after using it consistently for two weeks.

### Pros

#### 1. Ability to switch between different LLMs

One standout feature of Cursor is its flexibility in allowing users to switch between different large language models (LLMs). This gave me the freedom to choose the best model for specific tasks, whether it was generating code, debugging, or creating documentation.

#### 2. Productivity booster
Using Cursor significantly boosted my productivity. The AI’s ability to generate boilerplate code, suggest improvements, and automate repetitive tasks allowed me to focus on more complex and creative aspects of development.

#### 3. Confidence booster

There’s something reassuring about having an AI partner that can validate your ideas and solutions. Cursor provided real-time feedback, which gave me the confidence to tackle challenging problems with greater assurance.

#### 4. Effortless test case and documentation generation

Cursor excelled at generating test cases and documentation. These are tasks that often feel tedious but are crucial for maintaining code quality and readability. With Cursor, these tasks were completed in seconds, saving me valuable time.

#### 5. Problem-solving powerhouse

One of the most impressive aspects of Cursor was its ability to help solve difficult problems. Tasks that would have taken me hours to figure out on my own were resolved in minutes with its assistance. This feature alone made the experience incredibly valuable.

#### 6. A great learning tool

Cursor didn’t just help me complete tasks; it also served as an excellent learning resource. By analyzing its suggestions and reasoning, I was able to deepen my understanding of various coding concepts and best practices.

### Cons

#### 1. Pricey for my taste

While Cursor’s features are impressive, its pricing is a bit steep for my budget. It’s a tool I’d love to use long-term, but the cost might be prohibitive for individual developers or those working on a tight budget.

#### 2. Overly helpful at times

There were moments when Cursor’s assistance felt intrusive. Its eagerness to help sometimes disrupted my coding flow, especially when I just wanted to think through a problem on my own.

#### 3. Dependence on AI

One concern I have is the potential for over-reliance on AI. Using Cursor made certain tasks so effortless that I worried about losing the ability to tackle these challenges independently in the long run.

#### 4. File editing concerns

The ability of Cursor to edit, create, and delete files autonomously is both a strength and a potential risk. While this functionality is convenient, it also felt a bit unsettling to grant such control to an AI tool.

### Final thoughts

Overall, my 14 days with Cursor were enlightening. The tool has tremendous potential to revolutionize how developers write and manage code. Its ability to boost productivity, provide learning opportunities, and solve complex problems makes it an invaluable asset for any programmer.

That said, the pricing and potential downsides, such as over-reliance and concerns about file management, give me pause. For now, I’ll weigh the pros and cons carefully before deciding whether to invest in a subscription.

If you’re curious about Cursor, I recommend giving the free trial a shot. You might find that it’s exactly what you’ve been looking for to elevate your coding game.
