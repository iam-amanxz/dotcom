In today's tutorial, we will be learning how to create a simple JWT
authentication system with Express. I assume you have a little bit of knowledge
of Express, Node.js, and JWT to follow along.

### Creating a Node project

Let's start by creating a new Node project. Head over to the terminal and
navigate to the directory you want to create the project in. Then run the
following commands to create a new folder and initiate a node project with
default settings. This will generate a `package.json` file in the root directory
of the project.

> You can use your own project name instead of `express-jwt-authentication` if
> you wish.

```bash
mkdir express-jwt-authentication
cd express-jwt-authentication
npm init -y
```

### Installing the dependencies

Now we can install the following dependencies we need for our project.

- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - Express web framework
- [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) - We will use this
  library to create and verify JWT tokens

Run the following command in your terminal to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install express jsonwebtoken dotenv --save
```

#### Additional development setup

To make our lives easier, let's do some additional development setup.

We will install `nodemon` globally to auto restart our web server whenever we
make changes to our code. We will also add a development script to our
package.json file to run our server when we run `npm dev`.

> You don't have to run this command if you have already installed nodemon
> globally on your machine.

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

Now your `package.json` file should look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "express-jwt-authentication",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.2",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^8.5.1"
  }
}
```

Delete the `test` script and add the following script to your `package.json`
file

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon index.js"
}
```

With that step, we are ready to start developing.

### Creating the server

Create a new file called `index.js` in the root directory of your project. and
add the following code:

```js
const express = require('express')

const app = express()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen('3000', () => {
  console.log('server is running on port 3000')
})
```

Then start the server by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now you can see `nodemon` in action. This will start our server on port 3000.

{/* <BlogImage src="/blog-images/nodemon-logs.webp" alt="nodemon logs" /> */}

Now if we send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000` we should get the text
`Hello World!`. Let's test it out by sending a `curl` request on the terminal.

> If you want to use an HTTP client like Postman, you can do that too.

```
curl http://localhost:3000
Hello World!
```

If you see the same, great! our server works as expected.

### Creating the authentication endpoints

It's time to create the authentication endpoints that we will use to register
and login the users.

First we will create our registration endpoint. Delete the Hello World endpoint
we no longer need and replace it with the following code:

```js
app.post('/register', (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body

  if (!email || !password) {
    return res.status(400).send('Email and password are required')
  }

  const registered = users.find((user) => user.email === email)
  if (registered) {
    return res.status(409).send({ error: 'User already exists' })
  }

  const user = { email, password }
  users.push(user)

  const accessToken = jwt.sign({ sub: email }, 'MY_JWT_SECRET_KEY')

  res.status(201).json({ accessToken })
})
```

That was a lot of code. Let's tackle it piece by piece.

```js
app.post('/register', (req, res) => {
```

Here we are saying that if we receive a POST request to the `/register`
endpoint, execute the following code.

```js
const { email, password } = req.body

if (!email || !password) {
  return res.status(400).json('Email and password are required')
}
```

Here in line 1, we are doing a bit of ES6 destructuring and extracting the email
and password from the request body.

Then we are checking if the email and password are provided in the request body.
If not we are returning a `400 - Bad Request` status code and sending an error
message to the user.

```js
const registered = users.find((user) => user.email === email)

if (registered) {
  return res.status(409).send({ error: 'User already exists' })
}
```

Next, we are checking if the user is already registered by checking if the email
is present in our database. If so, we are returning a `409 - Conflict` status
code and sending an error message to the user.

Now, you might be wondering from where did the `users` array come from? Well,
this is the mock in-memory database that we will define in a bit. You can
imagine this coming from a real database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL. I am using
an in-memory database for simplicity.

```js
const user = { email, password }
users.push(user)
```

Here, if the user is not registered, we are creating a user object and adding it
to our in-memory database.

> For simplicityâ€™s sake, we are not hashing the password here. But if you are
> developing a production-grade application, always hash the password before
> storing it in the database.

```js
const accessToken = jwt.sign({ sub: email }, 'MY_JWT_SECRET_KEY')

res.status(201).json({ accessToken })
```

Now, for the most important part, we are creating a JWT access token sending it
along with the response, so that the user can use it to authenticate to our
application.

Make sure to import `jwt` on top of your `index.js` file like so.

```js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')
```

We can pass any useful information as the first argument to the `sign` function.
This information will be publicly available for anyone who gets their hands on
the token. That's why it is so important not to include any sensitive
information in the token. In this case, we are passing the email of the user so
that we can later use this to identify which user is trying to authenticate. The
key name `sub` is a convention that we use to identify the subject of the JWT.
You can use any name you want.

As the second argument, we must pass a JWT secret key. You can use any string
here. But it's so important that you keep this hidden from your code. Also, it's
a good idea to use a strong and complex string as the key. For demonstration
purposes, I have used a simple string and hardcoded it in the code. But **never
ever hardcode your JWT secret key inside your code in production**. You can use
an environment variable for this by creating a `.env` file in the root directory
of your project and excluding it from source control. Then you can access that
variable using a package like [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

Also if you want to quickly generate a strong and complex string for your JWT
secret, you can make use of the built-in Node `crypto` library like so.

Now you might be tempted to test out the `/register` endpoint. But before that,
we need to add some important things.

First, let's add our in-memory database. Add the following `users` array
somewhere in the `index.js` file.

```js
const users = [{ email: 'user1@mail.com', password: 'password' }]
```

We have also hardcoded one user object in our in-memory database so that we
don't always have to create a user before we can login.

Next, add the body parser middleware to our server. You must add this before
defining any route endpoints. This will allow us to extract the json body from
the request.

```js
app.use(express.json())
```

With this, our `/register` endpoint is ready. Now let's test it out.

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/register
{"error":"Email and password are required"}
```

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/register -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"email": "user1@mail.com", "password": "password"}'
{"error":"Email already registered"}
```

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/register -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"email": "newuser@mail.com", "password": "password"}'
{"accessToken":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJuZXd1c2VyQG1haWwuY29tIiwiaWF0IjoxNjQzODIwMTE5fQ.vL6L-TzKkR8jd8iGUqUb3v6xfzhBN9a7CGW3wOispfo"}
```

Cool! now we can register a new user, as well as our validations, are working.

Now let's add the `/login` endpoint as well.

```js
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body

  if (!email || !password) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Email and password are required' })
  }

  const registered = users.find((user) => user.email === email)
  if (!registered) {
    return res.status(302).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' })
  }

  if (registered.password !== password) {
    return res.status(302).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' })
  }

  const accessToken = jwt.sign({ sub: email }, process.env.JWT_ACCESS_SECRET, {
    expiresIn: process.env.JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN,
  })

  res.status(200).json({ accessToken })
})
```

Let's break it down.

I don't think the first couple of lines need explanation. They are the same as
in the `/register` route.

```js
const registered = users.find((user) => user.email === email)
if (!registered) {
  return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' })
}
```

Here, we are checking if the user is present in our database with the provided
email. If not, we are returning a `401 - Unauthorized` status code and sending
an error message to the user.

```js
if (registered.password !== password) {
  return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' })
}
```

Next, we are checking if the password provided by the user matches with the user
in the database. If not, we are returning a `401 - Unauthorized` status code and
sending an error message to the user.

```js
const accessToken = jwt.sign({ sub: email }, process.env.JWT_ACCESS_SECRET, {
  expiresIn: process.env.JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN,
})

res.status(200).json({ accessToken })
```

Finally, if all validations are passed, we will simply generate a JWT access
token and send it along with the response like before.

With this, our `/login` endpoint is also ready. Now let's test it out.

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/login
{"error":"Email and password are required"}
```

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/login -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"email": "unregistered@mail.com", "password": "password"}'
{"error":"Invalid credentials"}
```

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/login -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"email": "user1@mail.com", "password": "wrongpassword"}'
{"error":"Invalid credentials"}
```

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/login -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"email": "user1@mail.com", "password": "password"}'
{"accessToken":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyMUBtYWlsLmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTY0MzgyMTI1OCwiZXhwIjoxNjQzODI0ODU4fQ.SzOrY5NZpOKInqfzUAd1l4Dadj7XwNGvwS3QKgupfoM"}
```

Looks like our `/login` route works as expected.

### The protected route

Now we need a protected route to test our authentication functionality. If the
user is authenticated with our application only we should allow them to access
the resources within this route.

We also need a way to somehow intercept each request for this route and check if
the user is logged in.

First, let's add a new GET request handler in the `/protected` endpoint.

```js
app.get('/protected', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: `You are viewing a protected route` })
})
```

Now let's try sending a GET request to this endpoint.

```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/protected
{"message":"You are viewing a protected route"}
```

Well, looks like we can access this route without any sort of authentication.
Let's not allow that.

To achieve this, we can use express middleware. Middleware are functions that
are executed during the life cycle of a request to the Express server. This
means we can define a function that should run before the route handler and
intercept the request. We can then check if the user is authenticated or not. If
they are authenticated we will allow them to access the route.

Add the following function:

```js
function requireAuthentication(req, res, next) {
  const authorizationHeader = req.headers.authorization

  if (!authorizationHeader) {
    return res.status(401).send({ error: 'Unauthorized' })
  }

  const token = authorizationHeader.split(' ')[1]

  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).send({ error: 'Unauthorized' })
  }

  try {
    const payload = jwt.verify(token, 'MY_JWT_SECRET_KEY')

    const user = users.find((user) => user.email === payload.sub)
    delete user.password
    req.user = user

    next()
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(401).send({ error: 'Unauthorized' })
  }
}
```

As usual, let's break it down.

```js
function requireAuthentication(req, res, next) {
```

Here we are defining a function called `requireAuthentication`. This function
will take three arguments: `req`, `res` and `next`. The `req` and `res`
arguments are as same as our other route handlers. Since this will be a
middleware function, we will additionally get a `next` function as the third
argument.

We can define as many middleware functions as we want for any route. We can use
the `next` function to call the next middleware when we make sure the user is
authenticated. In our case, we only have one middleware. Therefore, it will call
our route handler.

```js
const authorizationHeader = req.headers.authorization

if (!authorizationHeader) {
  return res.status(401).send({ error: 'Unauthorized' })
}

const token = authorizationHeader.split(' ')[1]

if (!token) {
  return res.status(401).send({ error: 'Unauthorized' })
}
```

If a user wants to authenticate using JWT, they will send an `Authorization`
header with the `Bearer` token in their request. We can extract the token from
the header and verify it. Upon successful verification, we will authenticate the
user

First, we will implement some validation logic. We will check if the
`authorization` header is provided with the request. If not, we will return a
`401 - Unauthorized` status code and send an error message to the user.

Then we will try to split the `authorization` header into two parts. The first
part should be `Bearer` and the second part should be the token. If the format
is incorrect we will return a `401 - Unauthorized` status code and send an error
message to the user.

If the user provided the correct format, we will get the token from the second
part of the `authorization` header.

```js
try {
  const payload = jwt.verify(token, 'MY_JWT_SECRET_KEY')

  const user = users.find((user) => user.email === payload.sub)
  delete user.password
  req.user = user

  next()
} catch (error) {
  res.status(401).send({ error: 'Unauthorized' })
}
```

Finally, the important bit. We will verify the token with the `verify` method.
We have to pass the token and the secret key as the first and second arguments
respectively.

The secret key we are passing must match the one we used to sign the JWT token.

This verification could fail. therefore we need to handle the error. We can do
so by wrapping this in a `try catch` statement.

Upon error, we will return a `401 - Unauthorized` status code and send an error

If the verification is successful, we will get the payload of the token. We can
assign it to a variable called `payload`. This payload will contain the
information we passed during the signing of the token. In our case, it should
contain the user's email address.

This means our user is authenticated. We can now call the next function to move
on to the next middleware. But before that, we will find the user in our
in-memory database by the email we get from the payload and attach it to the
request. This will help us to access the user's data in the route handler via
request object.

Notice that we are also deleting the user's password before attaching it to the
request to prevent access to unnecessary information.

Now, how do we use this middleware? Well, we can add it to our `/protected`
route handler like so.

```js
app.get('/protected', requireAuthentication, (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: `You are viewing a protected route` })
})
```

This will make sure to run our middleware before processing the user request.

Before testing out, we will make a small change to our `/protected` route.

```js
app.get('/protected', requireAuthentication, (req, res) => {
  const { email } = req.user
  res
    .status(200)
    .json({ message: `You are viewing a protected route as ${email}` })
})
```

Remember, when we attached the user information to request object if the user is
authenticated? Well, we can now make use of it in our route handler. We will
extract the user's email address from the request object and use it to display a
message to the user.

Great, It's testing time...

First, let's try to access the `/protected` route without authentication as
before.

```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/protected
{"error":"Unauthorized"}
```

Cool! we can no longer access this route without authentication.

Let's provide test it out with the correct authentication token. We will get a
valid token by logging in to our application with our mock user
`user1@mail.com`.

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/login -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"email": "user1@mail.com", "password": "password"}'
{"accessToken":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyMUBtYWlsLmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTY0MzgyMTI1OCwiZXhwIjoxNjQzODI0ODU4fQ.SzOrY5NZpOKInqfzUAd1l4Dadj7XwNGvwS3QKgupfoM"}
```

```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/protected -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyMUBtYWlsLmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTY0MzgyMTI1OCwiZXhwIjoxNjQzODI0ODU4fQ.SzOrY5NZpOKInqfzUAd1l4Dadj7XwNGvwS3QKgupfoM'
{"message":"You are viewing a protected route as user1@mail.com"}
```

VoilÃ ! You can switch the in-memory database to a real database, hash the
password before storing in the database, extract the JWT secret key to a
environment variable and you have yourself a production-grade authentication
system.

You can find the source code for this tutorial on

Until we meet again! ðŸ™Œ
