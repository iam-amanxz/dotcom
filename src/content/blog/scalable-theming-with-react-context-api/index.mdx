Dark mode has been a thing for a while now. You will find it everywhere. In this
article, we will go a step further, and look at how to use React's Context API
to implement a scalable theme system with multiple themes. There are plenty of
ways to do this, but [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
is a perfect fit for this.

I won't be going into detail about how to use React Context API in this article.
I assume you already have a basic understanding of the Context API and React
Hooks.

Here is what we will build:

{/* <BlogImage src="https://i.imgur.com/KCRNAan.gif" alt="demo" /> */}

if you wanna go ahead and clone the starter project, you can do so by going to
this [repo](https://github.com/iam-amanxz/react-theming-context-api) and
navigating to the
[starter](https://github.com/iam-amanxz/react-theming-context-api/tree/starter)
branch. The final code is available on the
[final](https://github.com/iam-amanxz/react-theming-context-api/tree/final)
branch of the repo.

Throughout this article, we will be following the below steps to achieve this:

- Bootstrap a React project
- Create theme context and theme provider
- Access theme from the app
- Update theme
- Persist theme and autoload on restart

Alright, buckle up, and let's get started!

### Bootstrapping a React project

There are several ways to quickly bootstrap a React project. In this tutorial, I
will use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to bootstrap a React project. You can also
use [Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev/) (CRA) if you prefer.

You can skip this section if you have already downloaded the starter project or
created the project using CRA.

Assuming you have already installed
[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) on your
machine, execute the following command on your terminal to initiate a new Vite
project creation.

```shell
npm init vite
```

Follow the instruction to create a new React project using Vite.

{/* <BlogImage src="/blog-images/project-setup.webp" alt="demo" /> */}

1. In the first step, give your project a name
2. Next, choose `react` as the framework
3. Next, choose `react` as the variant. (You can choose `react-ts` if you prefer
   to use TypesScript.)
4. Then, navigate inside the project directory and run `npm install` to install
   all the dependencies.
5. Finally, run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

If you follow the steps, the development server should start at
`http://localhost:3000`, or on a different port if port 3000 is already in use.

#### Project cleanup

Let's do some housekeeping before we start.

1. We will start by deleting the `src/App.css` file.
2. We will also delete everything inside the `src/index.css` file. We will add
   the styles later.
3. Let's also delete the `src/logo.svg` file.
4. Next we will remove everything inside the `src/App.jsx` file and replace it
   with the following code:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <p>Hello React!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

### Creating the Theme Context

Now that we have a clean project, let's create the theme context.

First, create a new file in the `src` directory called `ThemeContext.jsx`.

Now we can import `createContext` from React and create the `ThemeContext` by
invoking the `createContext` function. This will create a new context object.

```jsx
import { createContext } from 'react'

const ThemeContext = createContext()
```

Next, we will create the `ThemeProvider` component. We will use this component
to wrap our entire application to provide our `ThemeContext` to all of our
components.

Notice we are passing an empty object as the `value` prop. We will come back to
this later, when we have created our theme state.

```jsx
const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

Now we will define a constant called `themes`. We will use this object to store
all our themes. You can easily extend this object to add more themes or more
color properties.

```jsx
const themes = {
  light: {
    background: '#eee',
    color: '#333',
  },
  dark: {
    background: '#111',
    color: '#fff',
  },
  dim: {
    background: '#15202b',
    color: '#f9f8fe',
  },
}
```

Now that we have our `themes` constant, we can create our `theme` state using
`useState` hook from React. We will use this state to store the current theme.
We will assign a default theme by passing `themes.light` as the initial value.
Make sure to import `useState` from React.

Next, we will pass down the `theme` state and `setTheme` function inside the
`value` prop of the `ThemeContext.Provider` component. This will allow all of
our components to access the `theme` state and `setTheme` function.

```jsx {2,5}
const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState(themes.light)

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

While we are here, let's create a helper hook called `useTheme` that will allow
us to access the theme context without needing to import the `ThemeContext`
component in all our files. Make sure to import `useContext` from React.

```jsx
const useTheme = () => useContext(ThemeContext)
```

Finally, we will export the `ThemeProvider` component as a default export, and
export `themes` object and `useTheme` hook as named exports.

```jsx
export { themes, useTheme }
export default ThemeProvider
```

### Providing the theme context to the application

Now that we have the `ThemeContext`, we need to provide it to the entire
application. We will do so by importing the `ThemeProvider` component inside the
`src/main.jsx` file, and wrapping our `App` component inside the `ThemeProvider`
component.

If you've been using CRA, you will do this inside `src/index.js` file.

```jsx {1,5,7}
import ThemeProvider from './ThemeContext'

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ThemeProvider>
      <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
)
```

### Accessing the theme from the application

With that step, everything is set up. Now we can access the theme from anywhere
in our up using the `useTheme` hook.

Before we do that, let's add some styling to our application. Add the following
styles to the `src/index.css` file:

```css
*,
*:before,
*:after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

body {
  margin: 0;
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto',
    'Oxygen', 'Ubuntu', 'Cantarell', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans',
    'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}

.app {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: #fcfcfc;
}

.app h1 {
  margin-bottom: 40px;
}

.theme-container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: #fff;
  padding: 10px;
  border-radius: 5px;
}

.theme-item {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 40px;
  width: 85px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
  margin: 0 5px;
}
.theme-item:hover {
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```

Next, replace the `App` component with the following inside the `src/App.jsx`:

Here, we are importing the `themes` object from `src/ThemeContext.jsx`. Then for
each theme item, we are returning a `div` with the corresponding theme
background color. `span` inside `div` is used to display the theme name.

```jsx
import { themes } from './ThemeContext'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <h1>Hello Context API</h1>

      <div className="theme-container">
        {Object.keys(themes).map((key) => {
          return (
            <div
              key={key}
              className="theme-item"
              style={{ backgroundColor: themes[key].background }}
            >
              <span style={{ color: themes[key].color }}>{key}</span>
            </div>
          )
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Finally, the moment we've been waiting for, we will import the `useTheme` hook
from `src/ThemeContext.jsx` and destructure the `theme` state from it inside the
`App` component.

Let's set the background color of the `App` component to the current theme's
background color. Also, make the `h1` text color to the current theme's color.

Since we are using the `light` theme as our default theme, we should be seeing
the light background color and the dark text color specified in `themes.light`
object.

```jsx {1,4,7,8}
import { themes, useTheme } from './ThemeContext'

const App = () => {
  const { theme } = useTheme()

  return (
    <div className="app" style={{ backgroundColor: theme.background }}>
      <h1 style={{ color: theme.color }}>Hello Context API</h1>

      <div className="theme-container">
        {Object.keys(themes).map((key) => {
          return (
            <div
              key={key}
              className="theme-item"
              style={{ backgroundColor: themes[key].background }}
            >
              <span style={{ color: themes[key].color }}>{key}</span>
            </div>
          )
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Changing the theme

With that, accessing the theme from the application is done. Now, let's add the
functionality to change the theme.

Destructure the `setTheme` function from the `useTheme` hook. Then we will add
on `onClick` event handler to the `div` that wraps the theme items. Next, we
will call the `setTheme` function with the theme item as the argument. we can
access the corresponding theme by passing `themes[key]` as the argument to the
`setTheme` function.

```jsx {4,16}
import { themes, useTheme } from './ThemeContext'

const App = () => {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme()

  return (
    <div className="app" style={{ backgroundColor: theme.background }}>
      <h1 style={{ color: theme.color }}>Hello Context API</h1>

      <div className="theme-container">
        {Object.keys(themes).map((key) => {
          return (
            <div
              key={key}
              className="theme-item"
              onClick={() => setTheme(themes[key])}
              style={{ backgroundColor: themes[key].background }}
            >
              <span style={{ color: themes[key].color }}>{key}</span>
            </div>
          )
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Persisting the theme

Let's also add the functionality to persist the theme. We can achieve this by
saving the theme object key to the `localStorage` whenever we change the theme.

To do this, let's make some changes to the `ThemeProvider` component inside the
`src/ThemeContext.jsx` file.

First we will add the `saveThemeToLocalStorage` function. This function will
take the theme key as the argument and save it to the `localStorage` under
`appTheme`.

```jsx
const saveThemeToLocalStorage = (key) => {
  localStorage.setItem('appTheme', key)
}
```

Next, we will define a function called `changeTheme` which will also take the
theme key as the argument. Within this function, we will call the `setTheme`
function with `themes[key]` as an argument, and `saveThemeToLocalStorage`
function with the theme key as the argument.

This will update the current theme state and also save the theme key to the
local storage.

```jsx
const changeTheme = (key) => {
  setTheme(themes[key])
  saveThemeToLocalStorage(key)
}
```

Then, we will add the `useEffect` hook to the `ThemeProvider` component with an
empty argument list. This hook will be called when the `ThemeProvider` component
is mounted to the DOM. Make sure to import `useEffect` from `react`.

inside the `useEffect` hook, we will check if the `localStorage` has a theme
saved under `appTheme`. If it does, we will call the `setTheme` function with
the `themes[localThemeKey]` as the argument. This will update the initial theme
state to the saved theme.

If we don't have a theme saved in the `localStorage`, it will use the default
`themes.light` theme.

Notice we are also checking if `themes[localThemeKey]` exists inside the if
condition. This will prevent the app from crashing if the theme key is not found
in the `themes` object. This can happen if some user had already saved a theme
and we deleted that theme from the `themes` object.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const localThemeKey = localStorage.getItem('appTheme')
  if (localThemeKey && themes[localThemeKey]) {
    setTheme(themes[localThemeKey])
  }
}, [])
```

We will also remove `setTheme` function from the values object and pass the new
`changeTheme` function instead.

```jsx {2}
return (
  <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, changeTheme }}>
    {children}
  </ThemeContext.Provider>
)
```

The final `ThemeProvider` component will look like this:

```jsx
const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState(themes.light)

  const saveThemeToLocalStorage = (key) => {
    localStorage.setItem('appTheme', key)
  }

  const changeTheme = (key) => {
    setTheme(themes[key])
    saveThemeToLocalStorage(key)
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    const localThemeKey = localStorage.getItem('appTheme')
    if (localThemeKey && themes[localThemeKey]) {
      setTheme(themes[localThemeKey])
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, changeTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

With that changes, we are no longer passing the `setTheme` function to the
context. Therefore, let's also remove the `setTheme` function and destructure
the `changeTheme` from the `useTheme` hook inside the `src/App.jsx` file.

Alter the `onClick` event handler to call the `changeTheme` function with the
key as the argument.

```jsx {2,13}
const App = () => {
  const { theme, changeTheme } = useTheme()

  return (
    <div className="app" style={{ backgroundColor: theme.background }}>
      <h1 style={{ color: theme.color }}>Hello Context API</h1>
      <div className="theme-container">
        {Object.keys(themes).map((key) => {
          return (
            <div
              key={key}
              className="theme-item"
              onClick={() => changeTheme(key)}
              style={{ backgroundColor: themes[key].background }}
            >
              <span style={{ color: themes[key].color }}>{key}</span>
            </div>
          )
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Extra: Adding more themes

That's it! We've built a scalable and extensible theme system using the Context
API.

Now, if you want to add more themes, you can do so by adding as many themes as
you want to the `themes` object. Everything else should work as it is.

```jsx {14,15,16,17}
const themes = {
  light: {
    background: '#eee',
    color: '#333',
  },
  dark: {
    background: '#111',
    color: '#fff',
  },
  dim: {
    background: '#15202b',
    color: '#f9f8fe',
  },
  sky: {
    background: '#548CFF',
    color: '#fff',
  },
}
```
